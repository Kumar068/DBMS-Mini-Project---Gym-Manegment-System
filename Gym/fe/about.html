        <center>What it means to be a <span id="class">SAYIAN</span></center>
    </h1>
    <p>First, let’s talk about what a Saiyan even is. A Saiyan is someone who strives to be a better version of themselves every day. We live by the code of “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”. There are going to be days where you’re unmotivated to
        the point where you dread the idea of stepping foot in a gym. However, a Saiyan never misses the opportunity to improve themselves physically.</p>
    <p>A Saiyan doesn’t only improve physically, but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. When you focus on just one of these aspects, the others will lack the same level of grade causing an imbalance in your life. With that being said, balance in
        these areas will create the closest thing to living a healthy lifestyle. Living a Saiyan lifestyle is living a truly healthy lifestyle.</p>
    <p>
        The Saiyans originated from Sadal, which it was later destroyed by the internal conflicts of the Saiyans. After that, the species stole another planet and named it . At some point in the past, a Super Saiyan God appeared. Detesting the evil in his race,
        five righteous Saiyans pooled their energies into this single Saiyan, creating a Super Saiyan God. The man fought off the evil Saiyans, but failed, due to the form's time limit, and evil once again took hold on planet.

        Saiyans possess a sexual reproductive system that is compatible with that of an Earthling, as evidenced by their producing of fertile half-breed children. Saiyans and Earthlings have the same concept of gender, and a male and female are required to produce
        a breeding pair.Saiyans, however, do not have much of a concept of family; they rarely form male-female relationships with the exception of breeding purposes. The one exception to this are the Saiyan royal family, which do apparently have close-knit
        family ties. Additionally, as children, Saiyans are kept in incubator pods until the parents decide they are ready to enter the battlefield.

        A Saiyan has a longer lifespan than a Earthling, though by how much remains unclear. Due to their nature as a war-mongering race, however, most Saiyans do not typically live to enjoy this benefit of their biology, and tend to die early in battle, making
        their average lifespan fairly short.Saiyan infants appear to develop at a faster rate than humans, as they're able to hold up their own necks much earlier than human babies, and appear to enjoy rough behavior that would be considered unsafe for
        a regular human infant.Saiyans have a naturally long childhood, retaining a small and childlike appearance for much of their early life, allowing them to deceive others around them as they grow older; after this, the body experiences a growth
        spurt that causes the Saiyan to grow into a size suited to fight. Beyond superficial changes from this point on, the Saiyan will hardly age.The Saiyans remain in their prime like this for far longer than Earthlings so they can enjoy the thrill
        of battle longer. and they quickly deteriorate after a certain age.
